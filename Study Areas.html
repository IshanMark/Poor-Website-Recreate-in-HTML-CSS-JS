				<p>GRAPHIC DESIGN (MFA)
					The graphic design program focuses on the development of a cohesive, investigative body of work, also known as the student’s thesis. At Yale, the graphic design thesis is conceived as a loose framework within which each student’s visual method is deployed across many diverse projects during the two-year course of study. While every thesis project is unique, there are several common features: a focus on methodology, the application of a visual method to studio work, and the organization of the work in a thoughtfully argued written document and “Thesis Book.”

					The individual collection of graphic design work by each student is supported on several levels simultaneously: studio work led by faculty meeting weekly; small six-person thesis groups meeting biweekly; individual sessions with writing and editing tutors; and lectures, presentations, and workshops.

					Although the School of Art provides digital lab facilities, all graphic design students are expected to have their own personal computer. Each student has a designated work space in the design studio loft and has access to equipment including bookbinding materials, wide format printers, a RISO duplicator, Vandercook press, and work spaces in the School of Art buildings. More resources supporting interdisciplinary projects including motion capture and VR is available at the nearby Center for Collaborative Arts and Media. In addition, students draw on the extraordinary resources of Yale University courses, conferences, films, lectures, and museums, and especially the extensive research and rare book collections of Sterling, Haas, and Beinecke libraries.

					Each year, up to twelve students are admitted into the two-year graphic design program, and up to six students are admitted into the preliminary-year program. Two-year program students are expected to have substantial and distinguished experience in visual studies and related professional experience. Students applying to the preliminary-year program typically have relevant experience in a field of study outside design and demonstrate evidence of visual acuity. After successful completion of the preliminary year, these students automatically continue on in the two-year M.F.A. program.

					Credit Requirements

					42 credits in area of concentration, including ART 949a, and 18 additional credits, including a minimum of 6 academic credits in courses outside the School of Art.

				<p>COVID UNDERGRAD ART FAQ
				Will the Creative and Performing Arts awards be available to support student art making this fall?

				Yes, Creative and Performing Arts Awards will be available this fall, with adaptations to fit the residential/remote mode. CPA funding is available to support solo projects or projects that are made using virtual collaborations. Any project funded by a fall 2020 CPA must make the final project available online, in order to be accessible to the residential/remote Yale College community. These virtual projects could take several forms and the Yale College Arts team is available to help students think about the possibilities. Details will be published on the Creative and Performing Arts website at link: <a href="https://creativeandperformingarts.yale.edu/">Click</a> <br>

				I am a visual artist. How can I share my work with the entire Yale Community online?
				<br>
				The Yale Office of Career Strategy has partnered with Wix to provide a multi-year premium account for free to currently enrolled Yale students. Students interested in exhibiting their visual arts projects may use this resource to share their work with the Yale community and beyond. Check out the https://www.yale20.art/ Yale BA Art 2020 Digital Thesis Archivefor inspiration on how to use Wix as an exhibition space.

				Can I access the Center for Collaborative Arts and Media (CCAM) this semester?
				<br>
				In-person CCAM computer lab and studio use is not available for the fall 2020 semester, for reasons of public safety during COVID-19. Curricular use of the CCAM Virtual Computing Lab will be available to designated enrolled students beginning September 2, 2020. CCAM photo and filmmaking equipment will be checked out on term-long loans to students who need the equipment to complete coursework. More information about the CCAM Virtual Computing Lab and long-term loans through the Lending Lab can be found here. CCAM will offer student employment opportunities, involving remote assignments. More information about student employment opportunities at the CCAM can be found on the CCAM website.

				<p>PAINTING AND PRINTMAKING (MFA)
					Instruction in the program is rooted in the investigation of painting as a unique genre with its own complex syntax and history. Within this setting, the program encourages diversity of practice and interpretation, innovation, and experimentation.

					Approximately twenty-one students are admitted each year. At the core of instruction are individual and group critiques with faculty, visiting critics, and visiting artists. In addition, students participate in a variety of seminars taught by both faculty and critics. The study of printmaking is integrated into the painting program, and a student may concentrate in painting, printmaking, or a combination of the two.

					Students work in individual 300-square-foot studios at 353 Crown Street adjacent to Green Hall. Students have access to a printmaking workshop in the Crown Street building, equipped with two etching presses and a lithography press, a fully equipped silkscreen facility, as well as digital resources available in the print studio, throughout the School, and at the Center for Collaborative Arts and Media.
