				<p class="text-justify">Dear Members of the School of Art Community,    
					<br>
				I have had the honor to serve as the first woman Dean of the School of Art, and now to enter the fifth year of that term upon the 150th anniversary of the School of Art’s founding and its enrollment of the first women at Yale University. My experience has been enriching, given the opportunities to lead, to teach, and to befriend some of the most engaging and dynamic young artists—artists who will soon become colleagues, co-teachers, and, most likely, my mentors. . . . . . . </p>

				<p class="text-justify">Dear MFA Students,<br><br>

				I hope that you are all well in the days leading up to our return from spring recess. I acknowledge the impact that moving to remote education has had on every member of our community and respect that this has not been an easy period of such rapid transition for anyone. Nevertheless, given the complications of social and professional life that the COVID-19 virus has imposed on our lives, we will begin with remote education on Monday, March 23rd. We are not living under normal conditions that allow us to continue with a studio-based practice, and so at this period of the pandemic remote education is the only alternative option. </p>
